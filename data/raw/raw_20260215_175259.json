We want to show, not just tell, the impact AI is having on companies — in this case, Axios.</em></p><ul><li><em>So we asked Dan to share what it's like to live the AI revolution.

Here's what Dan told us:</em></li></ul><p><strong>One of our best engineers </strong>recently completed a project similar to one he delivered a year ago.</p><ul><li>Last year, it took three weeks. This past week, he used AI-based \"agent teams\" and completed the same amount of work in 37 minutes.</li></ul><hr /><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the reality of the AI hype you read and hear about. Yes, coding is the first big place AI is hitting hardest. But I see every day how it will unfold across most other areas.</p><p><strong>Anticipating this AI shift</strong> six months ago, we refocused our product and tech organization, shrinking from 63 to 43 people to operate more nimbly in this new environment.</p><ul><li>The team <em>doubled</em> its output in January and will double that again this month. We're doing exponentially more ... with dramatically fewer people.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>In the tech world, especially in media, we were always constrained by what we call \"technical debt\" — the backlog of work any organization faces but never quite gets around to doing.</p><ul><li>Tech debt is gone. Not because we solved it, but because AI just made it irrelevant.</li><li>The Axios backlog, which was 12 months long, will be gone in months. Then the work really starts, as engineers become builders and begin to think beyond the limits of a request list.</li></ul><p><strong>Software engineers</strong> are living in a future that will soon arrive for all of us. Here's how the world has changed in just the past few<em> weeks:</em></p><p><strong>1. With tools</strong> like Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex, my team ships features in days instead of months.</p><ul><li>Agents now write better code than I can. Now I spend my time thinking about what we want to build — not how we want to build it.</li></ul><p><strong>2. We're no longer</strong> signing software contracts that run longer than a year. If it were possible, I'd insist on six months.</p><ul><li>We believe that before long, we'll be able to build that tool at near-zero cost.</li><li>This shows why software stocks have taken a brutal hit in recent weeks.</li></ul><p><strong>3. The bottleneck</strong> is no longer writing code. It's how fast humans can absorb change. We might end up creating things faster than humans can keep up.</p><ul><li>That could create feature fatigue <em>(\"Another update? We just had one\") </em>... trust erosion <em>(\"Do they have a vision for all this STUFF?\")</em> ... and cognitive overload <em>(\"I just learned the old way!\").</em></li></ul><p><strong>4. For CTOs navigating 2026: </strong>Your competitive advantage is no longer velocity. It's narrative coherence: You're not just shipping code, you're telling your users a story. Just in the past month, my job has changed.</p><p><strong>Job impact </strong>... <em>Axios CEO Jim VandeHei: </em>Axios wants to be transparent about how this plays out inside companies and affects total jobs. We worry others are hiding the implications, so we'll periodically use Axios as an example.</p><ul><li>That's why<strong> </strong>we shared the figures above from Dan — a 30% reduction in our product and tech team last year, given AI's coming capabilities. We started preparing for this almost two years ago, when that team was 90 people.</li><li>If you look<strong> </strong>through a two-year lens, we've cut our PDT team in half, but easily more than doubled output.</li></ul><p><strong>So when you hear warnings </strong>that AI will result in job losses in specific areas, that's why.</p><ul><li>Every company<strong> </strong>and every worker should be thinking through the implications. It's not all bad news: We're using these technologies to help reduce back-end costs in local news, so we can hire lots more journalists. More on that in a future story.</li></ul><p><em>Dan Cox has been Axios' chief technology officer since April 2025.

    "description": "<p>The Department of Homeland Security is rushing to fulfill President <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/15/trump-deportations-ice-polls-immigration\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's mass deportation goals</a>, and its haste has led to high-profile deportation screwups.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The high-visibility enforcement campaign has drawn attention to every tactic from Trump's immigration enforcers, including when they're on the wrong side of the law and public opinion.</p><hr /><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>As of late January, DHS said it had <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/20/dhs-sets-stage-another-historic-record-breaking-year-under-president-trump\" target=\"_blank\">deported</a> 675,000 undocumented immigrants.</p><ul><li>But from the earliest weeks of Trump 2.0, the administration has been challenged in the courts. </li><li>It has dealt with backlash for ignoring judicial orders and had to apologize for some wrongful deportations, although some of those deported are still fighting to return. </li><li>It has even faced ridicule after allowing a high-profile criminal suspect to avoid trial in the U.S. by asking for deportation. </li></ul><p>Below are five high-profile deportations that have gone awry.</p><h2>1. The suspected jewelry thief </h2><p>A man charged in the \"largest jewelry heist in U.S. history\" was deported before his trial. Much of the jewelry has not been found, according to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-21/jewelry-heist-deportation\" target=\"_blank\">the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><ul><li>An attorney for Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores, who was deported to Ecuador in December, argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice so it can't be refiled. The judge is still determining how to dismiss the case and whether it can be refiled if Flores ever returns to the U.S.</li><li>DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said that Flores was a legal permanent resident but had his status revoked because of his criminal record. </li><li>\"It's just beyond me how they would deport him without the prosecutors... being in on the conversation,\" former federal prosecutor Laurie Levenson told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/22/ice-jewelry-heist-suspect-self-deport\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a>.</li></ul><h2>2. The college student wrongfully deported over Thanksgiving</h2><p>Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, 19, planned a surprise visit home from Boston to Texas over Thanksgiving break. But after being detained at the airport, she was deported back to Honduras roughly 48 hours later.</p><ul><li>Belloza had a final order of removal but didn't know it. A judge ordered her not to be deported or moved out of state. But she was sent to Texas before the judge's order was seen and then deported.</li><li>\"I want to sincerely apologize,\" Assistant US Attorney Mark Sauter said in Boston federal court, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/13/metro/any-lopez-belloza-deported-court-hearing/?p1=StaffPage\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Globe</a>. \"The government regrets that violation and acknowledges that violation.\"</li><li>But the U.S. government is refusing to allow her to return, <a href=\"https://media.wbur.org/wp/2026/02/lopez-belloza.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">saying in early February</a> she is still subject to the removal order and is ineligible for a student visa. \"This illegal alien entered the country in 2014 and an immigration judge issued her a final order of removal in 2015. She was removed to Honduras. She received full due process,\" McLaughlin said.</li></ul><h2>3. The first deportee DHS had to bring back</h2><ul><li>A Guatemalan man wrongly deported to Mexico was returned to the U.S. in June after a judicial order.</li><li>Known by his initials <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/29/trump-immigrants-deported-guatemala\" target=\"_blank\">O.C.G.</a> in court records, his attorneys argued that the man shouldn't have been sent to Mexico because he'd been held for ransom and raped there. They successfully won a withholding agreement because <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/25/trump-admin-deportees-return-judge-order\" target=\"_blank\">O.C.G. also feared return</a> to his native Guatemala.</li><li>But he was deported to Mexico, whose government sent him back to Guatemala. There he went into hiding, according to his lawyers, before he was returned to the U.S.</li></ul><h2>4. The long saga of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/11/trump-kilmar-abrego-ice-release-wrongfully-deported\" target=\"_blank\">Kilmar Abrego Garcia</a></h2><p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are fighting for their client to be deported to Costa Rica. The U.S. government is fighting to stop his removal, insisting he be sent to one of several African countries instead. </p><ul><li>Garcia was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and sent to the notorious prison CECOT. He was sent back to the U.S. in June and then charged with human trafficking, only to be released on a judge's order in December.</li><li>Garcia's team were able to secure refugee status for him since <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/costa-rica-accept-abrego-garcia-conclusion-criminal-sentence/story?id=124897725\" target=\"_blank\">August</a> in Costa Rica. Garcia lost his asylum case in 2019 but has a withholding order not to be returned to his native El Salvador.</li><li>His case is no longer unique, his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenber told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/03/g-s1-108426/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-immigration-mistaken-deportations\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a>. \"There have been countless illegal deportation cases since then. If anything, the problem is getting worse and not better.\"</li></ul><h2>5.

    "content": "<p>The Department of Homeland Security is rushing to fulfill President <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/15/trump-deportations-ice-polls-immigration\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's mass deportation goals</a>, and its haste has led to high-profile deportation screwups.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The high-visibility enforcement campaign has drawn attention to every tactic from Trump's immigration enforcers, including when they're on the wrong side of the law and public opinion.</p><hr /><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>As of late January, DHS said it had <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/20/dhs-sets-stage-another-historic-record-breaking-year-under-president-trump\" target=\"_blank\">deported</a> 675,000 undocumented immigrants.</p><ul><li>But from the earliest weeks of Trump 2.0, the administration has been challenged in the courts. </li><li>It has dealt with backlash for ignoring judicial orders and had to apologize for some wrongful deportations, although some of those deported are still fighting to return. </li><li>It has even faced ridicule after allowing a high-profile criminal suspect to avoid trial in the U.S. by asking for deportation. </li></ul><p>Below are five high-profile deportations that have gone awry.</p><h2>1. The suspected jewelry thief </h2><p>A man charged in the \"largest jewelry heist in U.S. history\" was deported before his trial. Much of the jewelry has not been found, according to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-21/jewelry-heist-deportation\" target=\"_blank\">the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><ul><li>An attorney for Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores, who was deported to Ecuador in December, argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice so it can't be refiled. The judge is still determining how to dismiss the case and whether it can be refiled if Flores ever returns to the U.S.</li><li>DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said that Flores was a legal permanent resident but had his status revoked because of his criminal record. </li><li>\"It's just beyond me how they would deport him without the prosecutors... being in on the conversation,\" former federal prosecutor Laurie Levenson told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/22/ice-jewelry-heist-suspect-self-deport\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a>.</li></ul><h2>2. The college student wrongfully deported over Thanksgiving</h2><p>Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, 19, planned a surprise visit home from Boston to Texas over Thanksgiving break. But after being detained at the airport, she was deported back to Honduras roughly 48 hours later.</p><ul><li>Belloza had a final order of removal but didn't know it. A judge ordered her not to be deported or moved out of state. But she was sent to Texas before the judge's order was seen and then deported.</li><li>\"I want to sincerely apologize,\" Assistant US Attorney Mark Sauter said in Boston federal court, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/13/metro/any-lopez-belloza-deported-court-hearing/?p1=StaffPage\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Globe</a>. \"The government regrets that violation and acknowledges that violation.\"</li><li>But the U.S. government is refusing to allow her to return, <a href=\"https://media.wbur.org/wp/2026/02/lopez-belloza.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">saying in early February</a> she is still subject to the removal order and is ineligible for a student visa. \"This illegal alien entered the country in 2014 and an immigration judge issued her a final order of removal in 2015. She was removed to Honduras. She received full due process,\" McLaughlin said.</li></ul><h2>3. The first deportee DHS had to bring back</h2><ul><li>A Guatemalan man wrongly deported to Mexico was returned to the U.S. in June after a judicial order.</li><li>Known by his initials <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/29/trump-immigrants-deported-guatemala\" target=\"_blank\">O.C.G.</a> in court records, his attorneys argued that the man shouldn't have been sent to Mexico because he'd been held for ransom and raped there. They successfully won a withholding agreement because <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/25/trump-admin-deportees-return-judge-order\" target=\"_blank\">O.C.G. also feared return</a> to his native Guatemala.</li><li>But he was deported to Mexico, whose government sent him back to Guatemala. There he went into hiding, according to his lawyers, before he was returned to the U.S.</li></ul><h2>4. The long saga of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/12/11/trump-kilmar-abrego-ice-release-wrongfully-deported\" target=\"_blank\">Kilmar Abrego Garcia</a></h2><p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are fighting for their client to be deported to Costa Rica. The U.S. government is fighting to stop his removal, insisting he be sent to one of several African countries instead. </p><ul><li>Garcia was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and sent to the notorious prison CECOT. He was sent back to the U.S. in June and then charged with human trafficking, only to be released on a judge's order in December.</li><li>Garcia's team were able to secure refugee status for him since <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/costa-rica-accept-abrego-garcia-conclusion-criminal-sentence/story?id=124897725\" target=\"_blank\">August</a> in Costa Rica. Garcia lost his asylum case in 2019 but has a withholding order not to be returned to his native El Salvador.</li><li>His case is no longer unique, his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenber told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/03/g-s1-108426/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-immigration-mistaken-deportations\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a>. \"There have been countless illegal deportation cases since then. If anything, the problem is getting worse and not better.\"</li></ul><h2>5.

    "description": "<p>Axios CEO Jim VandeHei is here with advice on how to use your insecurities to motivate you.\n\n<em>For a video version of this column (and to see what Jim looked like as a 20-year-old punk), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThN8t4Apq6Q\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em>\n\n <strong>I wasn't a fast,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/17/ai-coding-claude-apps\" target=\"_blank\">early adopter</a> of AI beyond basic search on ChatGPT, <em>Jim writes</em>, for the same reason many of you have balked at these muscular new tools: I was insecure about my ability to use it with any sophistication.</p><ul><li>My internal dialogue: I'm too old, too non-technical, too much of a words guy to make it work.</li><li>Classic imposter moment: Who am I to think I can do this?</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>But I used my insecurity as a powerful motivator, much like I did in my early media career when I feared everyone in D.C. was better read, better educated, better connected than I was. (Spoiler: They were!)</p><hr /><p><strong>I attacked it.</strong> I started building things — apps, tools, prototypes — with an AI model as my collaborator. No computer science degree. No coding boot camp. Just curiosity and stubbornness. </p><ul><li>And it worked. Not because I suddenly became technical, but because I refused to let the insecurity win.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>I've always assumed my insecurities are actually superpowers if used right. I wrote a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/weaponize-insecurity-chip-on-your-shoulder-self-confidence\" target=\"_blank\">Finish Line column</a> on this very topic in 2022.</p><ul><li>Since then, the science seems to confirm it: Insecurity might be exactly what we need.</li><li>The new <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/impostor-syndrome-and-its-surprising-upside\" target=\"_blank\">science of imposter syndrome</a> is striking. MIT Sloan researcher <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/basima-tewfik\" target=\"_blank\">Basima Tewfik</a> ran a lab experiment and found that people experiencing imposter thoughts exerted <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/how-imposter-syndrome-can-be-your-superpower\" target=\"_blank\">13% more effort</a> than their peers when the pressure was on. When they felt overwhelmed, the self-doubt didn't crush them. It fueled them.</li></ul><p><strong>A massive <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12117965/\" target=\"_blank\">global meta-analysis</a> </strong>published last year reviewed 30 studies covering nearly 12,000 people and found that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392159986_Global_prevalence_of_imposter_syndrome_in_health_service_providers_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">62% of high-achieving professionals</a> experience imposter syndrome. That's not a bug in the human operating system. That's a feature — if you know how to use it.</p><p><strong>Think about that: </strong>The majority of successful people around you feel like frauds. Most of us do. The question isn't whether you have imposter syndrome. It's whether you're using it in a healthy way.</p><p><strong>Here's a 2026 version</strong> of how to leverage your insecurity in an AI world:</p><ol><li><strong>Be honest</strong> — then get curious. My <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/weaponize-insecurity-chip-on-your-shoulder-self-confidence\" target=\"_blank\">original advice</a> was to understand your weaknesses. I'd sharpen that point. The people thriving in this AI moment aren't the ones with the fanciest résumés — they're the ones willing to say \"I don't know,\" then obsessively ask questions until they do.</li><li><strong>Attack the weakness daily.</strong> When AI hit, I could have done what a lot of people my age did: Delegate it to younger staffers, nod along in meetings, fake fluency. Instead, I spent nights and weekends building things — terrible at first, then less terrible, then actually useful. You'll be shocked by how quickly persistent effort erodes a limitation you assumed was permanent. The gap between \"I can't do this\" and \"I just did this\" is smaller than you think.</li><li><strong>Weaponize the fury.</strong> Michael Jordan <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/05/10/the-last-dance-why-michael-jordan-invented-slights-for-motivation/3103843001/\" target=\"_blank\">manufactured slights</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/five-slights-michael-jordan-turned-into-fuel-include-labradford-smith-fiction-george-karls-dinner-diss/\" target=\"_blank\">fuel his competitive edge</a>. That still works. But in this era, the best target for your fury isn't a rival or a critic — it's complacency. The people falling behind right now aren't the ones who lack talent. They're the ones who've gotten too comfortable. Channel the chip on your shoulder into relentless learning, not just relentless competing.</li><li><strong>Give yourself grace — but not an excuse.</strong> I still can't sing. I still can't dance. I'll never be great at Trivial Pursuit. At some point, lamenting what you can't do is wasted energy.

    "content": "<p>Axios CEO Jim VandeHei is here with advice on how to use your insecurities to motivate you.\n\n<em>For a video version of this column (and to see what Jim looked like as a 20-year-old punk), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThN8t4Apq6Q\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em>\n\n <strong>I wasn't a fast,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/17/ai-coding-claude-apps\" target=\"_blank\">early adopter</a> of AI beyond basic search on ChatGPT, <em>Jim writes</em>, for the same reason many of you have balked at these muscular new tools: I was insecure about my ability to use it with any sophistication.</p><ul><li>My internal dialogue: I'm too old, too non-technical, too much of a words guy to make it work.</li><li>Classic imposter moment: Who am I to think I can do this?</li></ul><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>But I used my insecurity as a powerful motivator, much like I did in my early media career when I feared everyone in D.C. was better read, better educated, better connected than I was. (Spoiler: They were!)</p><hr /><p><strong>I attacked it.</strong> I started building things — apps, tools, prototypes — with an AI model as my collaborator. No computer science degree. No coding boot camp. Just curiosity and stubbornness. </p><ul><li>And it worked. Not because I suddenly became technical, but because I refused to let the insecurity win.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>I've always assumed my insecurities are actually superpowers if used right. I wrote a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/weaponize-insecurity-chip-on-your-shoulder-self-confidence\" target=\"_blank\">Finish Line column</a> on this very topic in 2022.</p><ul><li>Since then, the science seems to confirm it: Insecurity might be exactly what we need.</li><li>The new <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/impostor-syndrome-and-its-surprising-upside\" target=\"_blank\">science of imposter syndrome</a> is striking. MIT Sloan researcher <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/basima-tewfik\" target=\"_blank\">Basima Tewfik</a> ran a lab experiment and found that people experiencing imposter thoughts exerted <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/how-imposter-syndrome-can-be-your-superpower\" target=\"_blank\">13% more effort</a> than their peers when the pressure was on. When they felt overwhelmed, the self-doubt didn't crush them. It fueled them.</li></ul><p><strong>A massive <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12117965/\" target=\"_blank\">global meta-analysis</a> </strong>published last year reviewed 30 studies covering nearly 12,000 people and found that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392159986_Global_prevalence_of_imposter_syndrome_in_health_service_providers_a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">62% of high-achieving professionals</a> experience imposter syndrome. That's not a bug in the human operating system. That's a feature — if you know how to use it.</p><p><strong>Think about that: </strong>The majority of successful people around you feel like frauds. Most of us do. The question isn't whether you have imposter syndrome. It's whether you're using it in a healthy way.</p><p><strong>Here's a 2026 version</strong> of how to leverage your insecurity in an AI world:</p><ol><li><strong>Be honest</strong> — then get curious. My <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/weaponize-insecurity-chip-on-your-shoulder-self-confidence\" target=\"_blank\">original advice</a> was to understand your weaknesses. I'd sharpen that point. The people thriving in this AI moment aren't the ones with the fanciest résumés — they're the ones willing to say \"I don't know,\" then obsessively ask questions until they do.</li><li><strong>Attack the weakness daily.</strong> When AI hit, I could have done what a lot of people my age did: Delegate it to younger staffers, nod along in meetings, fake fluency. Instead, I spent nights and weekends building things — terrible at first, then less terrible, then actually useful. You'll be shocked by how quickly persistent effort erodes a limitation you assumed was permanent. The gap between \"I can't do this\" and \"I just did this\" is smaller than you think.</li><li><strong>Weaponize the fury.</strong> Michael Jordan <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/05/10/the-last-dance-why-michael-jordan-invented-slights-for-motivation/3103843001/\" target=\"_blank\">manufactured slights</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/five-slights-michael-jordan-turned-into-fuel-include-labradford-smith-fiction-george-karls-dinner-diss/\" target=\"_blank\">fuel his competitive edge</a>. That still works. But in this era, the best target for your fury isn't a rival or a critic — it's complacency. The people falling behind right now aren't the ones who lack talent. They're the ones who've gotten too comfortable. Channel the chip on your shoulder into relentless learning, not just relentless competing.</li><li><strong>Give yourself grace — but not an excuse.</strong> I still can't sing. I still can't dance. I'll never be great at Trivial Pursuit. At some point, lamenting what you can't do is wasted energy. But — and this is the key update — don't confuse \"I'm not naturally good at this\" with \"I can't learn this.\" Those are very different things. The first is self-awareness. The second is a cop-out.</li></ol><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> No sane person is as confident as they seem.

117 of the Higher Education Act, which requires colleges and universities to report significant sources of foreign funding. </p><ul><li>\"Even when foreign funding is reported, its true sources are often hidden,\" the order claimed. </li><li>Trump also said at the time that his administration sought to \"protect the marketplace of ideas from propaganda sponsored by foreign governments, and

annually, for which the Education Department started releasing incomplete 2025 data last month. </li></ul><p><strong>Since last January, </strong>the Department has initiated four new investigations under Section 117. </p><ul><li>The includes Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan, \"amid reports of inaccurate and untimely foreign source gift and contract disclosures,\" the department noted. </li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>The disclosures include \"funding from countries and entities that are involved in activities that threaten America's national security,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-releases-latest-foreign-funding-disclosures-federally-funded-american-universities\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>.</p><ul><li>\"This transparency is essential not only to preserving the integrity of academic research but also to ensure the security and resilience of our nation,\" she said. </li><li>The White House and the Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>Characterizing this funding as a threat to national security is distorting things, Cooley says, adding that the data has \"real issues.\"</p><ul><li>The country of origin \"does not necessarily reflect the actual provenance of the individual or entity that's giving,\" he says. \"And on the flip side, donations from foreign individuals channelled through shell companies are not classified as foreign donations.\" </li></ul><p><strong>The reporting </strong>requirements also \"collapse a lot of different kind of activities,\" he says. </p><ul><li>Those activities include tuition reimbursements and scholarships for foreign students, he says, as well as contracts for \"joint campuses and satellite campuses\" abroad. </li><li>Qatar, from which schools reported the second largest outflow, has an education initiative sponsored by the Qatari government, and a number of U.S. schools — such as Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon University — have operations there. </li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>Foreign donations should be scrutinized like domestic ones, Cooley says, adding that he thinks transparency is generally a good idea for both, namely where individual actors are concerned. </p><ul><li>Jeffrey Epstein's initial donations to schools like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/nyregion/epstein-columbia-nyu-donations-admission-young-women.html\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2019/09/13/harvard-reviews-epsteins-89-million-gifts\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard</a> \"were not viewed as problematic,\" Cooley says. </li><li>\"After the reputation becomes toxic for very good reason,\" you see universities reassessing their relationships, he added, citing MIT's disclosure about its relationship with Saudi Arabia following the assassination of journalist <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2019/letter-regarding-mit-engagement-saudi-arabia-0206\" target=\"_blank\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>The Trump administration's grilling of schools stands in contrast to its softening of scrutiny elsewhere, such as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2025/05/14/a-look-at-the-qatari-lobby-00350757\" target=\"_blank\">lobbyists for foreign governments</a>, Cooley says. </p><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>\"I don't think the insight that money changes things is wrong.

annually, for which the Education Department started releasing incomplete 2025 data last month. </li></ul><p><strong>Since last January, </strong>the Department has initiated four new investigations under Section 117. </p><ul><li>The includes Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan, \"amid reports of inaccurate and untimely foreign source gift and contract disclosures,\" the department noted. </li></ul><p><strong>What they're saying: </strong>The disclosures include \"funding from countries and entities that are involved in activities that threaten America's national security,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-releases-latest-foreign-funding-disclosures-federally-funded-american-universities\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>.</p><ul><li>\"This transparency is essential not only to preserving the integrity of academic research but also to ensure the security and resilience of our nation,\" she said. </li><li>The White House and the Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>Characterizing this funding as a threat to national security is distorting things, Cooley says, adding that the data has \"real issues.\"</p><ul><li>The country of origin \"does not necessarily reflect the actual provenance of the individual or entity that's giving,\" he says. \"And on the flip side, donations from foreign individuals channelled through shell companies are not classified as foreign donations.\" </li></ul><p><strong>The reporting </strong>requirements also \"collapse a lot of different kind of activities,\" he says. </p><ul><li>Those activities include tuition reimbursements and scholarships for foreign students, he says, as well as contracts for \"joint campuses and satellite campuses\" abroad. </li><li>Qatar, from which schools reported the second largest outflow, has an education initiative sponsored by the Qatari government, and a number of U.S. schools — such as Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon University — have operations there. </li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in: </strong>Foreign donations should be scrutinized like domestic ones, Cooley says, adding that he thinks transparency is generally a good idea for both, namely where individual actors are concerned. </p><ul><li>Jeffrey Epstein's initial donations to schools like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/nyregion/epstein-columbia-nyu-donations-admission-young-women.html\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2019/09/13/harvard-reviews-epsteins-89-million-gifts\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard</a> \"were not viewed as problematic,\" Cooley says. </li><li>\"After the reputation becomes toxic for very good reason,\" you see universities reassessing their relationships, he added, citing MIT's disclosure about its relationship with Saudi Arabia following the assassination of journalist <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2019/letter-regarding-mit-engagement-saudi-arabia-0206\" target=\"_blank\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines: </strong>The Trump administration's grilling of schools stands in contrast to its softening of scrutiny elsewhere, such as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2025/05/14/a-look-at-the-qatari-lobby-00350757\" target=\"_blank\">lobbyists for foreign governments</a>, Cooley says. </p><p><strong>The bottom line: </strong>\"I don't think the insight that money changes things is wrong. It happens in all sectors,\" Cooley says. </p><ul><li>\"We just have to be really precise about what the channels of influence are and what we're trying to stop, as opposed to this guilt by association dynamic we have.\"</li></ul>",

Ford did not respond to Axios' request for comment.</p><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Trump paired his threats with additional warnings to Canada, which he says has treated the U.S. \"very unfairly for decades.\"</p><ul><li>Trump said the bridge didn't use American steel, a withering industry the president has said he wants to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/10/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\">revitalize</a>. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters Tuesday that the project was built with workers and steel from both sides of the border.</li><li>The president also slammed Ontario's decision to block U.S. alcoholic products from its shelves, a retaliatory policy launched by Trump's tariffs last year.</li><li>He also denounced as disastrous for Canada a proposed Canada-China <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/16/canada-china-us-trade-relations\" target=\"_blank\">trade deal</a> — announced shortly before Carney urged mid-sized countries at Davos to unite against <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/20/davos-trump-greenland-europe-carney-macron\" target=\"_blank\">geopolitical aggression</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>The other side:</strong> Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, <a href=\"https://chamber.ca/news/our-statement-on-the-u-s-administrations-threat-to-block-the-opening-of-the-gordie-howe-bridge/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Tuesday that \"blocking or barricading bridges is a self-defeating move.\"</p><ul><li>\"Modern border infrastructure strengthens shared economic security.

    "content": "<p>President <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a> has warned he would stop the Gordie Howe International Bridge between Detroit and Ontario from <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/detroit/2026/02/10/trump-threat-gordie-howe-bridge-michigan-economy\" target=\"_blank\">opening</a> unless Canada meets a list of U.S. demands unrelated to the bipartisan infrastructure project. </p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The threat could further inflame tensions with America's northern neighbors amid an ongoing trade war, sanctions and talk of making Canada the 51st state. </p><hr /><p><strong>Driving the news: </strong>Trump wrote on Truth Social Monday that he'd block the bridge unless the U.S. is \"fully compensated\" for everything America does for Canada.</p><ul><li>He said negotiations would begin immediately and demanded U.S. ownership of \"at least one half\" of the project.</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check: </strong>The bridge is jointly owned by Michigan and Canada, and the Canadian government completely financed the project, <a href=\"https://gordiehoweinternationalbridge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority. </p><ul><li>The bridge will be the largest land port along the U.S.-Canada border, and an expected 6,000 people will take the road to commute to Detroit from Ontario every day, <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/09/trump-threatens-to-block-gordie-howe-international-bridge-from-opening-michigan-ontario-canada/88597688007/\" target=\"_blank\">per</a> the Detroit News.</li><li>The project will connect major highways between both countries, alleviating commercial freight <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/detroit/2022/07/07/ambassador-bridge-plan-nears-collapse\" target=\"_blank\">traffic</a>. When the project was first announced under President Trump's first term, he called it a \"vital economic link between our two countries.\"</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue:</strong> The bridge would also provide a cheaper <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/detroit/2022/07/07/ambassador-bridge-plan-nears-collapse\" target=\"_blank\">alternative</a> to the Ambassador Bridge, a privately owned connection operated by Detroit trucking tycoon Matthew Moroun, who has repeatedly lobbied to cancel Gordie Howe.</p><ul><li>Prior to the Gordie Howe's construction, Moroun's bridge was perfectly placed to reap all the proceeds of international border crossings in the greater Windsor-Detroit area. </li><li>Moroun reportedly spoke to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hours before the president posted his dissatisfaction with the project, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/world/canada/bridge-owner-trump-lutnick.html\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to the New York Times.</li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> The bridge is also supposed to stabilize relations between U.S. and Canadian automakers, who have been on shaky footing since the president began imposing sweeping <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/lopsided-tariffs-squeeze-u-s-carmakers-future-of-mobility\" target=\"_blank\">auto tariffs</a> last year.</p><ul><li>The tariffs were particularly biting to the Windsor-Detroit region because automakers often move parts across the U.S.-Canada border multiple times before a vehicle is finished, meaning the two areas are intrinsically intertwined.</li></ul><p><strong>Two members of the Detroit Three,</strong> Stellantis and GM, declined Axios' request for comment. Ford did not respond to Axios' request for comment.</p><p><strong>Zoom out: </strong>Trump paired his threats with additional warnings to Canada, which he says has treated the U.S. \"very unfairly for decades.\"</p><ul><li>Trump said the bridge didn't use American steel, a withering industry the president has said he wants to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/10/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\">revitalize</a>. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters Tuesday that the project was built with workers and steel from both sides of the border.</li><li>The president also slammed Ontario's decision to block U.S. alcoholic products from its shelves, a retaliatory policy launched by Trump's tariffs last year.</li><li>He also denounced as disastrous for Canada a proposed Canada-China <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/16/canada-china-us-trade-relations\" target=\"_blank\">trade deal</a> — announced shortly before Carney urged mid-sized countries at Davos to unite against <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/20/davos-trump-greenland-europe-carney-macron\" target=\"_blank\">geopolitical aggression</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>The other side:</strong> Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, <a href=\"https://chamber.ca/news/our-statement-on-the-u-s-administrations-threat-to-block-the-opening-of-the-gordie-howe-bridge/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Tuesday that \"blocking or barricading bridges is a self-defeating move.\"</p><ul><li>\"Modern border infrastructure strengthens shared economic security.

    "description": "<p>With <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/04/washington-post-layoffs\" target=\"_blank\">the closure</a> of the Washington Post sports section, sports journalism lost one of its last crown jewels, and one of media's most prestigious professions was handed a crushing blow.</p><p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>The marquee platforms of sportswriting have been gutted and shuttered over the last decade — victims of cold, hard media business realities and the evolving demands of the modern sports fan.</p><hr /><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>There have never been more ways for sports fans to watch and learn about their favorite teams and players.

    "description": "<p>The U.S. wants Russia and Ukraine to sign a peace deal that ends the war by June, before President <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a> pivots to focusing his energy on the midterm elections, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The U.S. timeline Zelensky laid out is pretty ambitious, both because there are still significant gaps between Russia and Ukraine and because Ukraine will have to hold a referendum on the peace deal before it is signed — a process that can take several months.</p><hr /><ul><li>\"We had very good talks today having to do with Russia-Ukraine. Something could be happening,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Friday night.   </li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> Senior officials from Russia and Ukraine held on Wednesday and Thursday a second round of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/24/us-russia-ukraine-talks-abu-dhabi\" target=\"_blank\">negotiations</a> in Abu Dhabi mediated by Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. </p><ul><li>Zelensky said Friday the Russian delegation in Abu Dhabi has changed its rhetoric and instead of getting into \"historical arguments\" conducted a \"concrete\" discussion on what it is ready to do and what it isn't ready to do. </li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> The talks were held in a military working group that discussed the issue of how to monitor and observe a ceasefire once it is announced.</p><ul><li>Zelensky said that during the talks, the U.S. side confirmed it is going to be actively involved in monitoring a potential future ceasefire.  </li><li>Negotiations were also held in a political working group that discussed the main sticking point — Russia's demand that Ukraine withdraws its forces from parts of Donbas it still controls.   </li><li>Zelensky said Russia still demands a Ukrainian withdrawal from the parts of Donbas it still holds, but for the first time agreed to discuss the U.S. proposal to establish an economic zone in Donbas to try and bridge the gaps between the parties.</li><li>Nevertheless, he stressed that Ukraine's position is still that the territorial issue will be resolved according to the current lines. </li></ul><p><strong>What he's saying: </strong>\"'We stand where we stand' is the fairest and the most reliable model, in our view, for a ceasefire today,\" he said.</p><ul><li>\"The Americans are proposing that the war be brought to an end by the beginning of this summer, and they will probably pressure the parties according to this timeline,\" Zelensky said. </li><li>He explained that his understanding was that around June, the U.S. attention will shift to the congressional elections. </li><li>\"The elections are, for them, definitely more important. Let's not be naïve,\" he said. \"They say they want to achieve everything by June, and they will do everything possible to ensure the war ends that way.\" </li></ul><p><strong>State of play:</strong> Zelensky said that during the talks in Abu Dhabi earlier this week the U.S. proposed to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/29/russia-stop-bombing-kyiv-ukraine-trump-putin\" target=\"_blank\">resume the agreement</a> on suspending attacks on energy facilities. </p><ul><li>A similar initiative by Trump two weeks ago led to four days with no Russian attacks on power plants in Ukraine. </li><li>\"Ukraine has confirmed; Russia has not yet responded,\" Zelensky said.</li><li>Zelensky said that Russia and Ukraine discussed in Abu Dhabi for the first time the possibility that the most difficult sticking points that remain will be brought to a trilateral leaders' summit.</li></ul><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Zelensky said the Trump administration refuses to sign the U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees agreement, even though it is practically ready.</p><ul><li>He said the U.S. wants to sign it \"roughly at the same time\" with all other agreements that are part of the peace deal.</li><li>Zelensky stressed he wants to sign the security guarantees first to increase trust in Ukrainian public opinion that the peace deal will be real.</li><li>\"There can be no end to the war without security guarantees,\" he said. \"This is an absolute certainty.

    "content": "<p>The U.S. wants Russia and Ukraine to sign a peace deal that ends the war by June, before President <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a> pivots to focusing his energy on the midterm elections, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The U.S. timeline Zelensky laid out is pretty ambitious, both because there are still significant gaps between Russia and Ukraine and because Ukraine will have to hold a referendum on the peace deal before it is signed — a process that can take several months.</p><hr /><ul><li>\"We had very good talks today having to do with Russia-Ukraine. Something could be happening,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Friday night.   </li></ul><p><strong>Driving the news:</strong> Senior officials from Russia and Ukraine held on Wednesday and Thursday a second round of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/24/us-russia-ukraine-talks-abu-dhabi\" target=\"_blank\">negotiations</a> in Abu Dhabi mediated by Trump's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. </p><ul><li>Zelensky said Friday the Russian delegation in Abu Dhabi has changed its rhetoric and instead of getting into \"historical arguments\" conducted a \"concrete\" discussion on what it is ready to do and what it isn't ready to do. </li></ul><p><strong>Zoom in:</strong> The talks were held in a military working group that discussed the issue of how to monitor and observe a ceasefire once it is announced.</p><ul><li>Zelensky said that during the talks, the U.S. side confirmed it is going to be actively involved in monitoring a potential future ceasefire.  </li><li>Negotiations were also held in a political working group that discussed the main sticking point — Russia's demand that Ukraine withdraws its forces from parts of Donbas it still controls.   </li><li>Zelensky said Russia still demands a Ukrainian withdrawal from the parts of Donbas it still holds, but for the first time agreed to discuss the U.S. proposal to establish an economic zone in Donbas to try and bridge the gaps between the parties.</li><li>Nevertheless, he stressed that Ukraine's position is still that the territorial issue will be resolved according to the current lines. </li></ul><p><strong>What he's saying: </strong>\"'We stand where we stand' is the fairest and the most reliable model, in our view, for a ceasefire today,\" he said.</p><ul><li>\"The Americans are proposing that the war be brought to an end by the beginning of this summer, and they will probably pressure the parties according to this timeline,\" Zelensky said. </li><li>He explained that his understanding was that around June, the U.S. attention will shift to the congressional elections. </li><li>\"The elections are, for them, definitely more important. Let's not be naïve,\" he said. \"They say they want to achieve everything by June, and they will do everything possible to ensure the war ends that way.\" </li></ul><p><strong>State of play:</strong> Zelensky said that during the talks in Abu Dhabi earlier this week the U.S. proposed to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/29/russia-stop-bombing-kyiv-ukraine-trump-putin\" target=\"_blank\">resume the agreement</a> on suspending attacks on energy facilities. </p><ul><li>A similar initiative by Trump two weeks ago led to four days with no Russian attacks on power plants in Ukraine. </li><li>\"Ukraine has confirmed; Russia has not yet responded,\" Zelensky said.</li><li>Zelensky said that Russia and Ukraine discussed in Abu Dhabi for the first time the possibility that the most difficult sticking points that remain will be brought to a trilateral leaders' summit.</li></ul><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Zelensky said the Trump administration refuses to sign the U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees agreement, even though it is practically ready.</p><ul><li>He said the U.S. wants to sign it \"roughly at the same time\" with all other agreements that are part of the peace deal.</li><li>Zelensky stressed he wants to sign the security guarantees first to increase trust in Ukrainian public opinion that the peace deal will be real.</li><li>\"There can be no end to the war without security guarantees,\" he said. \"This is an absolute certainty. Everyone understands this. Ending the war requires security.\"</li></ul><p><strong>What's next:</strong> Zelensky said the U.S. has, for the first time, proposed that Ukrainian and Russian negotiators meet in the U.S., likely in Miami in a week to continue the talks. </p><ul><li>\"We have confirmed our participation,\" he said.</li></ul><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/05/new-start-arms-control-us-russia-extend\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. and Russia agree to observe New START nuclear pact after expiration</a></p><p><em>Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional details throughout.</em></p>",

To live in a city where such chocolate exists is a small fortune. To recognize that one cannot belong to it entirely is a quieter sorrow, a grief that must settle without spectacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years my relationship with chocolate was uncomplicated. International brands filled ordinary spaces. Grocery lines, airport stores, conference snack tables. They were agreeable, reliable, designed to satisfy without asking anything in return. I accepted them as one accepts certain customs: useful, unquestioned, sufficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malley’s existed in the background of my life long before I allowed myself to approach it closely. I knew its reputation. I remembered flavors that lingered longer than conversation. Textures that resisted quick conclusions. And surprisingly, while elegant and transformative, Malley’s is unassuming, humble, easy to access. But visiting the store itself felt like crossing an invisible boundary; stepping into a more particular world, one that invited attention rather than casual consumption. I arrived with a list of goals, gifts for others, but found myself mentally drafting a pros-and-cons table for personal consumption instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a gray February afternoon, I entered with the intention of choosing a single elegant gift. The displays were arranged with calm assurance. Nothing felt extraneous. Each seemed to reveal a preference I had not yet admitted to myself. I experienced an unexpected sense of recognition, as though encountering something familiar yet newly significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temptation was not excess but intimacy. The feeling that one could understand every variety, explore every possibility. For a brief moment I imagined a life organized entirely around Malley’s, a life of uninterrupted sweetness. Reason intervened quickly: health, balance, the ordinary structures that sustain a respectable existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, I lingered longer than intended. My fingertips moved across the displays with a care that surprised me. A quiet awareness traveled upward; physical, unmistakable, and difficult to justify. Language softened; time shifted. Eventually I left, not because desire faded but because I understood that certain experiences deepen when approached with restraint. I wondered if the clerk had ever witnessed someone tallying the calories of longing in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the weeks that followed, I returned to familiar routines. Commercial chocolate resumed its modest place in daily life, a reminder of equilibrium. Yet something had changed internally. The knowledge of Malley’s introduced a subtle tension. A private awareness that these vivid flavors existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distance became an act of preservation. Occasional visits. Small boxes. Careful choices as if I were training for a disciplined life of chocolate austerity. The longing did not disappear; it matured into a quiet appreciation shaped by boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some pleasures must remain partially unrealized to retain their meaning. Not because they are forbidden outright, but because their intensity would disrupt the fragile architecture of ordinary days. They remain part of the landscape: familiar, luminous, approached with gratitude and caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Malley’s sign disappears completely from view, I feel neither regret nor triumph. Only the calm recognition that certain attachments are sustained best through respectful distance. Known, cherished, and never allowed to overtake the life that surrounds them. A small box sits in the passenger seat, a quiet monument, and only later do I notice my vision blur slightly, as though the winter air had followed me into the car. I tell myself that the occasional Malley’s indulgence is sophisticated research, trusting my insulin to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/ClevesceneNewsletterSignup/Page\">Subscribe to Cleveland Scene newsletters.</a></strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Follow us:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apple.news/T3zEhGlfYTLKMdgomjEL19Q\">Apple News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKQgKIiNDQklTRkFnTWFoQUtEbU5zWlhabGMyTmxibVV1WTI5dEtBQVAB?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen\">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/@c/1599763?s=01\">NewsBreak</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClevelandScene/\">Reddit</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clevelandscene/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ClevelandScene\">Facebook&nbsp;</a>|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClevelandScene\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;| Or sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/syndication\">RSS Feed</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/news/cleveland-news/my-review-of-malleys-chocolates/\">My Review of Malley’s Chocolates</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",

Sometime this spring, he will open <a href=\"https://ddhonkytonk.com/\">Double D’s Honky Tonk and Smokehouse</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dykstra is a Northeast Ohio native, but he left home to pursue a career in hospitality. For more than a decade he has worked for the Shake Shack restaurant chain. As area director, he oversaw operations at a dozen different locations in multiple states. More importantly, he worked for Danny Meyer, one of the most respected names in hospitality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I consider myself unbelievably lucky to have worked for him,” says Dykstra. “I got the playbook on how to do it right and intentional and with fiscal discipline, which is worth its weight in gold.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Brim/Hola property is an 8,000-square-foot, two-level building with massive windows, tall ceilings and exposed rafters. The upper level boasts a walkout patio with expansive views. Constructed in 2016, the property is in fine form, says Dykstra, needing only minor aesthetic work to fit his concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The bones are all here,” he explains. “It’s all cosmetic work to make it feel like that Western, honky-tonk kind of space. It’s going to feel old and rustic, but not commercialized.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan is to work with the modern farmhouse vibe that already exists in the white-brick and black-steel building. Design elements like reclaimed barn wood, corrugated metal, whiskey barrels, vintage milk cans and hay bales will play up the honky-tonk theme. To go with the hoedown atmosphere, there will be a menu of Southern fare that leans heavily into barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A wood-fired smoker will turn out beef brisket, pork belly, burnt ends, pulled pork, pulled chicken and smoked sausage. Those items will be served Texas-style on large platters loaded with smoked meats, pickles, onions and bread. For those who prefer to skip the barbecue there are deviled eggs, fried pickles, BLTs starring house-smoked bacon, fried chicken and smash burgers. “An ode to Shake Shack,” Dykstra says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there will be plenty of whiskey and tequila to wash it all down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upper level will be home to a bar and stage for live music and line dances. There will be no food service up there, except for casual summer cookouts on the patio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dustin Dykstra isn’t the only “double D” in the clan, he says, stating that both his mother and his son share the alliterative condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s just meant to be fun, eye catching,” he says about the playful name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for Double D’s Honky Tonk and Smokehouse to open in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-324912\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/double-d-honky-tonk-smokehouse.png?resize=780%2C539&#038;quality=80&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/ClevesceneNewsletterSignup/Page\">Subscribe to CLE Bites, Doug Trattner’s weekly food newsletter.</a></strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Follow us:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKQgKIiNDQklTRkFnTWFoQUtEbU5zWlhabGMyTmxibVV1WTI5dEtBQVAB?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen\">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/@c/1599763?s=01\">NewsBreak</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClevelandScene/\">Reddit</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clevelandscene/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ClevelandScene\">Facebook&nbsp;</a>|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClevelandScene\">Twitter</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/food-drink/double-ds-honky-tonk-and-smokehouse-to-open-in-willoughby/\">Double D’s Honky Tonk and Smokehouse to Open in Willoughby</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",

Ohio Democrats would like to see the same restrictions applied to law enforcement officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"h-\">State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Township, has introduced Ohio <a href=\"https://legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/hb236\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">House Bill 236</a>, which creates a new offense of “masked harassment” which is punishable as a first-degree misdemeanor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"h-\">The state’s aggravated riot statutes get new masking offenses as well. Wearing a mask while engaging in disorderly conduct with four or more individuals is a fifth-degree felony. Doing so with the intent of committing an act of violence would be a third-degree felony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"h-\">Additionally, Williams proposes a new sentencing specification for any felony committed by someone concealing their identity. If they’re found guilty, they’d face a one-year mandatory prison term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In recent years,” Williams told a House committee Wednesday, “we’ve witnessed a troubling increase in individuals concealing their identities, often with masks, while engaging in harassment, trespass and violent crimes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Increasing the penalties for wearing a mask while committing a crime,” he went on, “clearly sends a message: concealment for the purpose of evading accountability will not be tolerated in our communities and in our state.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing a mask not only helps an offender evade punishment, Williams said, it “intensifies the psychological terror” victims suffer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He invoked protests outside a Los Angeles Synagogue and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/06/16/repub/members-of-congress-on-edge-after-assassination-of-minnesota-state-legislator/\">the assassination in Minnesota</a>&nbsp;of a state lawmaker and her husband.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Together we can reinforce the rule of law, protect our communities and ensure that no one can use anonymity as a shield for criminal behavior,” Williams insisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats on the committee asked the question likely on the mind of anyone following President Trump’s immigration crackdown or the looming government shutdown over Department of Homeland Security funding: OK, what about ICE?</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-goose-meet-gander\">Goose meet gander</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting last December, thousands of Department of Homeland Security officers, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, descended on the Twin Cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, the agency claims it has arrested 3,000 undocumented people. The operation has also led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/briefs/nothing-about-what-is-going-on-here-is-normal-a-fight-over-evidence-in-good-pretti-cases/\">the killing of two U.S. citizens</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backlash has been swift and fierce. In addition to a shake up in the operation’s leadership, Congressional Democrats are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/01/29/repub/us-senate-dems-demand-mask-ban-body-camera-requirement-ids-for-immigration-agents/\">threatening to hold up funding for DHS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of their central demands is prohibiting federal agents from carrying out their duty in masks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I could not, you know,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;think about ICE and federal law enforcement and what’s been happening over the last few months,” Ohio state Rep. Ismail Mohamed told Williams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained Ohio Democrats have proposed legislation requiring all law enforcement officers, with limited exceptions, to identify themselves and not wear masks on duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So, I guess would you be in favor of this applying to law enforcement as well?” Mohamed asked about Williams’ proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams said he would not be supportive of legislation that “dictates” what federal law enforcement can and can’t do in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted a mask ban in California was recently blocked in the courts because it exempts state police — thereby discriminating against federal officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohamed asked about exceptions for individuals wearing a mask for safety or medical reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams turned him down and pointed to Ohio’s gun possession sentencing specification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If a defendant comes in court and says, I didn’t plan on using the gun in the commission of crime, we said your possession of the gun is enough to get a one-year (sentence) specification here in the state of Ohio,” Williams said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who’s protected?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some law enforcement officers in Ohio already hide their identity, Williams argued, and it’s important that they do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve seen gang units in my community conceal their identity. I’ve seen undercover officers conceal their identity for purposes of investigative integrity. And what we’re seeing now is doxing federal immigration enforcement,” Williams said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State Rep. Phil Plummer, R-Dayton, agreed it’s “so important to mask these officers up.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before serving in the statehouse, Plummer was the Montgomery County Sheriff, and in that role, he oversaw several officers engaged in drug enforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These cartels threaten my officer’s lives. They threaten my officer’s children’s lives,” Plummer said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We all know I can Google anybody sitting in this room and find out where you live in two minutes, maybe a minute and a half, very simple. It’s all out there on the net.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohio state Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna, brushed those arguments off as red herrings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mask ban Ohio Democrats have proposed applies to local, state, and federal officers equally, and carries exceptions for masks worn for safety, by SWAT units or undercover officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She noted as well that Ohio law already grants sweeping protections to keep public safety officials’ personal information out of public records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m struggling to see why we would have, I guess, a different First Amendment right apply,” she said, when law enforcement officers receive protections that private citizens can’t access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams rejected the idea that his bill creates different levels of constitutional rights, and he made another comparison to Ohio’s sentencing rules for gun possession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you have a gun in your possession when you commit an offense, guess what? It’s a one-year weapon specification,” he said. “That doesn’t mean it lowered your constitutional right to carry a gun.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking after the hearing, Williams acknowledged there was a time — back when local governments worked with federal agencies and opponents weren’t “doxing elected officials” — when it wouldn’t have been acceptable for law enforcement officers to conceal their identity in the line of duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now, with the political climate that we have in the United States,” he said, “I think it is absolutely reasonable for law enforcement officers, such as ICE, to conceal their identities for the safety and security of those officers moving forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Originally published by the <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/02/13/ohio-republican-lawmaker-wants-stiffer-penalties-for-masked-offenders-as-dems-ask-what-about-ice/\">Ohio Capital Journal.</a> Republished here with permission.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/news/ohio-news/ohio-republican-lawmaker-wants-stiffer-penalties-for-masked-offenders-as-dems-ask-what-about-ice/\">Ohio Republican Lawmaker Wants Stiffer Penalties for Masked Offenders as Dems Ask, What About ICE?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",

Hand-in-hand with that special someone, explore eclectic streets, savor flavors that tell a story and uncover hidden gems that make The Land the ultimate backdrop for <strong>L-O-V-E</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s some inspiration to help you plan a date that feels both elevated and unforgettable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dinner Date</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Westsiders</strong> promises refined romance vibes with a modern twist. Known for handcrafted cocktails, scratch-made pastas and seasonal dishes like salmon and scallops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’ll see unique cocktails&nbsp; you won’t find elsewhere” says Madison Berner, director of public relations for Local Hospitality Group. “It’s a great spot whether you want the full dinner or just appetizers and drinks.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rocky River favorite is a larger space but still feels private and intimate, offering three distinct areas: the lounge and bar is comfortable and relaxed, ideal for a first date or cocktails; the dining room is designed for a more traditional romantic dinner; and the garage area has low-top tables and sofa seating areas for a cozy feel. Reservations are recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FIRST DATE TIP:</strong> <em>Start with cocktails at the bar and, if sparks fly, stay for dinner. The bar is full-service and comfortable for a full meal.&nbsp; 19880 Detroit Road, Rocky River, 440-488-9908, <a href=\"http://westsiders.com\">westsiders.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you think of date night, barbecue might not be the first cuisine that comes to mind, but <strong>Landmark Smokehouse</strong> has been proving couples wrong for years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Landmark is known for its elevated barbecue, but what truly sets it apart is its exclusive bourbon collection. With 22 custom barrel picks — including two house tequilas and 20 bourbons you won’t find anywhere else — Landmark boasts one of the best bourbon selections in the city. For bourbon lovers, this is a date night destination that surprises and impresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With seating for about 56 guests, Landmark feels intimate yet lively. The new furniture and design create a comfortable, upscale environment where guests love to linger. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends, as this spot is a go-to for birthdays, anniversaries and date nights. Reservations are highly recommended, especially on weekends, as this spot is a go-to for birthdays, anniversaries and date nights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The number of times I’ve sent champagne to tables because it’s an anniversary or an engagement — it’s definitely a date night spot,” says Cody Cammarn, general manager.&nbsp; “Barbecue doesn’t usually scream romance, but for whatever reason, it works.”&nbsp;<em>11637 Clifton Blvd., Cleveland, 216-230-4040, <a href=\"http://landmarksmokehouse.com\">landmarksmokehouse.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"close up shot of a steak on a plate\" class=\"wp-image-324486\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/steak-love-in-the-land.jpg?resize=780%2C624&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption><span class=\"image-credit\"><span class=\"credit-label-wrapper\">Credit:</span> Courtesy Hangry Brands</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re aiming for a date night that feels like an occasion, <strong>STEAK</strong> in Tremont is a showstopper. This is where you add special notes and expect a few surprises along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s the main event,” says Julia Licastro, VP of Operations for Hangry Brands. “We do custom menus for special events, and we try to create those wow moments — because people want places they can tell stories about.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From cocktails served in bathtubs with rubber duckies to hidden flasks tucked inside books, STEAK leans into playful luxury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Like, oh my God, I ordered the build-your-own sundae and all my toppings came out on a ferris wheel,” Licastro laughs. “Or our carnival crab cakes — they’re like corn dogs, but with crab cakes inside.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the little details matter: The front door is a repurposed vintage meat cooler, the windows are blacked out for an immersive vibe and checks come with Hershey’s Kisses and temporary tattoos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Those cheeky touches open up opportunities for conversation and laughter,” Licastro says. “Even if the date’s not going great, you can still share a giggle.” Reservations are recommended.<em>12179 W. 11th St., Cleveland, 216-331-2724, <a href=\"http://steakcle.com\" id=\"steakcle.com\" type=\"link\">steakcle.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-324476\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/geracis.jpg?resize=780%2C624&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption><span class=\"image-credit\"><span class=\"credit-label-wrapper\">Credit:</span> Courtesy Geraci&#039;s Slice Shop</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes date night calls for a casual stop in for a slice of pie, and <strong>Geraci’s Slice Shop</strong> delivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located near Rocket Arena and Progressive Field, it’s the ultimate pre- or post-game hangout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Perfect if you’re going to a Cavs or Monsters game and want to grab a quick bite,” says Julia Licastro, vice president of operations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vibe is pure nostalgia: think ’80s pizzeria style with vintage decor, Pac-Man machines and a soundtrack of throwback hits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s all about that big slice of pizza,” Licastro adds. “Served New York-style on paper plates.

Enter <strong>Birdietown</strong>, Cleveland’s only indoor mini golf hotspot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Located in Lakewood’s Birdtown neighborhood, Birdietown is the manifestation of a date-night dream from owners Tim and Erin Frazee. “I literally have a brown paper napkin from Bar Cento in a frame where we sketched out a corner building with a corner entrance, and it looks remarkably like what we ended up with,” Erin recalls. “That was 15 years ago.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birdietown more than delivers on that vision with a two-story, one-of-a-kind concept that includes stunning bars, a menu of delicious shareables and unique libations (try the FORE! Play) and two nine-hole courses (one on each level) — all packaged in a sparkling, stylish atmosphere that feels special.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We love cozying up at a bar to have dinner,” Erin says. “So it was important that we had beautiful bars. Upstairs, it’s lively and glowing with the chandelier. Downstairs, it’s much more loungey, like a speakeasy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In just a year since opening, Birdietown has become a little love nest, now a popular spot for blind dates, first dates, proposals and even couples stopping in for photos on their wedding day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mini-golf might be a winning icebreaker for a high-stakes first date: “You have something to do with your hands,” Erin says with a laugh. “My personal favorite is when people come in, have cocktails and play golf. It’s an activity, so it breaks the ice right away. You have a drink, then dinner, and if the night’s going well, you can go downstairs and play another nine holes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy hour makes Birdietown a great after-work meetup spot, and after 7 p.m. the space becomes strictly 21+, creating a true adults-only escape.<em>12501 Madison Ave., Lakewood, <a href=\"http://birdietowncle.com\">birdietowncle.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Cleveland Rocks Climbing\" class=\"wp-image-324480\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Cleveland-Rocks-love-in-the-land.jpg?resize=780%2C624&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption><span class=\"image-credit\"><span class=\"credit-label-wrapper\">Credit:</span> Courtesy Love Cleveland Neighborhoods</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Want to take your date to the next level?

Consider <strong>Loganberry Books</strong> on Larchmere, featuring themed rooms and floor-to-ceiling shelves, the <strong>ThirdSpace Reading Room</strong> in Glenville, which celebrates Black culture and hosts reading circles, and <strong>Visible Voice</strong> in Ohio City, now located in a stunning former theater with plans for live music and readings.&nbsp;<em> 13015 Larchmere Blvd., Cleveland, 216-795-9800, <a href=\"http://loganberrybooks.com\">loganberrybooks.com</a> 1464 E. 105th St., Cleveland, 440-753-1275, <a href=\"http://thirdspacereadingroom.com\" id=\"thirdspacereadingroom.com\" type=\"link\">thirdspacereadingroom.com</a> 4601 Lorain Ave., Cleveland, 216-961-0084, <a href=\"http://visiblevoicebooks.com\">visiblevoicebooks.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheers to Romance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sultry, sophisticated spirits to celebrate a special evening, head to <strong>Society Speakeasy</strong> in the heart of downtown on East Fourth Street. Hangry Brands acquired this Cleveland staple in April and turned up the speakeasy vibes to full volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We even moved the entrance,” says Julia Licastro, vice president of operations, explains. “Now, when you walk downstairs, it looks like a maintenance room with hard hats and work orders. Then you enter through a broom closet lined with actual brooms and mops — and suddenly you’re in this glamorous, cave-like bar with plush banquettes and bathtubs turned into tables.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crowd is strictly 21+, making it ideal for romantic evenings. The cocktail program ranges from adventurous craft creations to classics done perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you want the best espresso martini you’ve ever had, we’ve got that,” Licastro says. “But if you’re feeling bold, we’ve got experimental options too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pair your drink with a snack tray of popcorn, nuts and pretzels — or indulge in decadent desserts like gold-dusted chocolate mousse cake or rotating cheesecakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s the perfect spot before or after dinner — or for a nightcap after Playhouse Square,” Licastro adds.&nbsp;<em>2063 East Fourth Street, Cleveland, 216-930-2655, <a href=\"http://societycleveland.com\" id=\"societycleveland.com\" type=\"link\">societycleveland.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"a view of the exterior and patio of Humble Wine Bar\" class=\"wp-image-324482\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/hunble-wine-bar-love-in-the-land.jpg?resize=780%2C624&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption><span class=\"image-credit\"><span class=\"credit-label-wrapper\">Credit:</span> Courtesy Humble Wine Bar</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the heart of downtown Lakewood, you’ll find <strong>Humble Wine Bar</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a date night that feels warm and inviting — like a fine wine and bubbling wood-fired pizza — Humble has glowing reviews as a date-night favorite. Tucked into Detroit’s streetscape in the heart of the city, Humble offers rustic charm, globally inspired flavors and an atmosphere that makes you want to linger whether it’s a romantic evening, a first date or a night out with friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We want people to feel comfortable, whether they’re sharing small plates, sipping cocktails or just enjoying the vibe,” says Nick Deeb, who, along with Geoff Mathias, took ownership of Humble in May 2025. “Hospitality is everything to us. We love taking care of people and creating a space where they can relax and connect.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bar seating is especially intimate. “You’re right in front of the pizza oven, so there’s this warmth and energy that makes the experience special,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humble recently refreshed its menu with bold, global flavors sure to get the date-night buzzing. The wine list goes beyond the basics, featuring varietals like Nebbiolo, Trebbiano, Cabernet Franc and even a white Pinot Noir. The seasonal cocktail menu is equally creative, with options like a pancetta fat-washed whiskey and peach drink, an ube-infused egg white sour and a spiced pear daiquiri. Bourbon lovers will appreciate the curated selection featuring E.H. Taylor and Blanton’s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>End the date with the Humble’s hit dessert cocktail: The Banana Fana Fo Fini, a banana espresso martini topped with a bruleed banana slice. “People love it,” Deeb says.&nbsp;<em>15400 Detroit Ave., Lakewood, 216-767-5977, <a href=\"http://humblewinebar.com\">humblewinebar.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tour a Neighborhood</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with <strong>Poppy</strong> on Larchmere in the Greater Buckeye neighborhood.

Chef-Owner Kolnita Riggins-Walker is known for her signature whitefish and decadent desserts like banana bread crumble.

Call your friends and meet them indoors somewhere fun and entertaining. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dips, Sips and More</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything more decadent than a plump, juicy strawberry dipped in dark chocolate? But maybe you and your best friend would prefer dipping grapes, bananas or pineapples into melted chocolate. On Valentine’s Day, The Winery at Chateau Hough presents Dip &amp; Sip, an activity that pairs three holiday favorites — wine, chocolate and fruit. Two time slots (12:30 to 3 p.m. and 4 to 6:30 p.m.) are available with reservations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can’t make Valentine’s Day? “Let’s Make Wine,” on March 14, is perfect for a group of friends who use kits to explore the entire winemaking process and go home (after four sessions that extend into May) each with their own gallon of wine. Also, “Suds and Sips” is the winery’s soap making session on April 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Winery at Chateau Hough was founded in 2019 and supports the nonprofit Neighborhood Solutions Inc. The winery’s manager, Brenda Frazier, urges friends to “come, have fun and meet people.” Also, wear clothes that you don’t mind getting a little rose wine on if you do “Let’s Make Wine.” Participants can get pretty enthusiastic, warns Frazier.<em>1650 E. 66th St., 216-438-0964, <a href=\"http://chateauhough.com\">chateauhough.com</a>; use <a href=\"http://exploretock.com\">exploretock.com</a> for reservations   </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Roll it Out</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People don’t just want something to do, they want something to remember,” says RollHouse Entertainment’s Chef Marketing Officer Phil Carpenter. That means tons of laughs and a menu stacked with casual favorites, including smash burgers, sliders, pizza and craft cocktails. With locations in Solon, Mentor and North Olmsted, RollHouse offers “high-energy experiences including Cosmic Bowling, escape rooms and a great arcade,” says Carpenter. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“RollHouse is a place to celebrate the people you love spending time with. It’s where fun lives,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valentine’s Day reservations are available online.<em>7300 Palisades Parkway, Mentor, <a href=\"mailto:mentor@therollhouse.com\">mentor@therollhouse.com</a>; 24488 Lorain Road, North Olmsted, <a href=\"mailto:northolmsted@therollhouse.com\">northolmsted@therollhouse.com</a>; 33185 Bainbridge Road, Solon, <a href=\"mailto:solon@therollhouse.com\">solon@therollhouse.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Build Your Own Candle&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you and your bestie would enjoy a visit to The Cleveland Candle Company in Ohio City, where you can breathe in any of the amazing 150 to 200+ scents that can be chosen to create a custom candle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Gin, a partner at The Cleveland Candle Company, recommends Rose Petals, Sacred Sandalwood and Cabernet Sauvignon. But about 30 choices of candle jars are also available. Still, Gin says he’d “probably go” with the Vintage Glass options or the Colored Ceramic jars for a February 14 creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s the adventure of smelling through our vast scent collection and having the shared experience that makes every candle-making session so satisfying,” says Gin. “Every time you light the candle you made, it brings back the memory of who you were with.”<em>2032 West 25th St., 216-471-8477, <a href=\"http://clecandleco.com\">clecandleco.com  </a>       </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visit an Urban Winery</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CLE Urban Winery is known for its many and varied top-notch activities, educational events and entertainment. This month is certainly no exception at the working winery and tasting room.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Valentine’s Wine Flight and Food Pairing experience will be offered that holiday weekend along with live jazz performances on the 13th (7 to 9 p.m.) and 15th (6 to 8 p.m.). (Advance tickets for the wine tasting and food pairing available on Eventbrite; a limited number of tickets available for walk-ins.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cleveland Heights winery provides a relaxed environment for besties and buddies to learn more about Ohio-made wine and enjoy time together. (How can anyone pass on a specialty wine called Hopped in the Heights?) But if you choose to abstain that is ok, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In addition to a full bar, we have non-alcoholic beer, wine, cider and spirits for delightful mocktails,” says owner Destiny Burns. “We also offer premium Italian sparkling sodas and other soft drinks.” <em>2180 Lee Road, 216-417-8313, <a href=\"http://cleurbanwinery.com\">cleurbanwinery.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/for-the-love-of-cle/4-friend-date-activities-to-try-this-winter/\">4 Friend-Date Activities to Try This Winter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",

Meet several:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All City Candy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Heart-shaped candy is my favorite candy. (It’s) made with love and truly makes my heart full. It’s timeless, joyful and instantly brings a smile,” says Elisabeth Sapell, founder and president of All City Candy in Richmond Heights. “My favorite conversation heart saying over the years has always been, ‘You’re sweet,’ which feels especially appropriate for a candy lady.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the “premium chocolates from the fine chocolate cases are always a great hit for Valentine’s Day — they are beautiful, indulgent and meant to be shared,” according to Sapell. She also suggests a bouquet of chocolate roses, “which lasts a little longer than the real thing,” and the hand-dipped strawberries that are made only twice a year (Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sapell, a lifelong chocolate lover, opened her family business in 2013. She now sells an endless variety of candy at her retail location (curbside pickup is also offered) and online. That includes cinnamon jelly hearts, cherry-flavored lollipops and milk chocolate marshmallow hearts. She also loves to make gifts combos “that feel thoughtful, nostalgic and fun” and suggests:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• </strong><strong>$25 to $40</strong> – a sweet mix of conversation hearts, retro Valentine candy, gourmet chocolate bars and seasonal treats</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• </strong><strong>$50 to $75</strong> – Valentine gift box with chocolate-covered pretzels, caramels and premium chocolates</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• $100</strong> – deluxe gift assortment with premier chocolates, chocolate-dipped Oreos, nostalgic favorites and seasonal Valentine treats.<em>746 Richmond Road, Richmond Heights, 216-487-7070, <a href=\"http://allcitycandy.com\" id=\"allcitycandy.com\" type=\"link\">allcitycandy.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Urban Orchid</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect the unexpected if you order a Valentine’s Day floral arrangement from The Urban Orchid. “We try to make every flower arrangement specific. You can’t just say, ‘I want the Have-a-Nice-Day bouquet.’ We ask about the person you are sending it to, maybe their favorite colors, style, flowers,” explains owner and designer Brandon Sitler, whose shops are in Tremont and Ohio City/Hingetown. “Of course, you can’t wait too long to order or some things may be gone.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitler incorporates lots of “bright and cheery, vibrant jewel tones” into his floral creations. But more February 14 traditional colors are also available, of course. Winter designs may feature roses, peonies, hydrangeas and orchids, plus a surprise or two with an unusual choice of vegetation not often seen in creations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our clients are looking for that Urban Orchid design, look and feel,” says Sitler.&nbsp; “That means super textured and unique.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitler teaches floral design classes and holds events at the Tremont location, while Ohio City is more of a walk-in shop. But each sells gift baskets, locally made candles, chocolates, indoor plants, containers and Cleveland-themed items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The designer has two suggestions. Don’t limit fresh flowers to just the living or dining rooms. They are beautiful in any room. And if you put them in a bathroom, they’ll love the moisture in the air from the shower. Also, don’t forget to add water to any container and/or replace it with fresh, clean water no matter where it is displayed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The flowers will last longer,” he says.<br /><em>Tremont Design Studio, 3154 W. 14th St., 216-785-3618; Ohio City/Hingetown, 1455 W. 29th St., 216-589-0788; <a href=\"http://theurbanorchid.com\" id=\"theurbanorchid.com\" type=\"link\">theurbanorchid.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Colorful chocolate candies\" class=\"wp-image-324455\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/518133209_1168071682004841_3558562618458584852_n-e1770655477690-1024x683.jpg?resize=780%2C520&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption><span class=\"image-credit\"><span class=\"credit-label-wrapper\">Credit:</span> Sweet Bean Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sweet Bean</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sweet Bean, a chocolate studio and shop in Cleveland’s Collinwood neighborhood, opened in February 2021. If all goes according to schedule, owner and founder Kristin Barnes will be in her new spot this February, only four blocks away. The move from just under 1,000 square feet to 3,000 square feet will allow expansion for larger and more frequent tasting classes and other events. (Barnes may temporarily operate both locations until the move is settled.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an extraordinary Valentine’s Day gift, Barnes invites shoppers to “build a box of hand-painted bonbons,” the chocolates she calls the “rock stars” of her business and which have brought her local fame.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Some people call them jewels, crystals, planets, bowling balls. The bonbons are shiny and bright and our tagline is that they are almost too pretty to eat,” says Barnes, who began making fine chocolates in 2013. “The most popular assortment is the nine-piece gift box. You can find Sweet Bean chocolates at some other locations across the city, but those are pre-mixed. If you come in and build a box yourself, that’s part of the excitement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barnes says what sets her chocolate apart from “grocery store chocolate” is her product’s “really high cocoa butter content which makes it decadent and luscious.”&nbsp; One or two pieces is all someone needs to feel full and satisfied — it’s not like eating handfuls of M&amp;M’s, she says. Usually, 24 painted bonbon varieties are available at any one time in the shop. But do think about Hazelnut (Barnes’ personal favorite), Salted Caramel, Brownie Batter and one the chocolatier said is coming on strong — Mexican Hot Cocoa. <em>present location: 819 E. 185th St.; new location: 701 E. 185th St.; 216-795-5561; <a href=\"http://sweetbeancandies.com\" id=\"sweetbeancandies.com\" type=\"link\">sweetbeancandies.com</a>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"A candle and a box of matches from Mishi Lifestyle\" class=\"wp-image-324484\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.clevescene.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/mishi.jpg?resize=780%2C624&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"780\" /><figcaption><span class=\"image-credit\"><span class=\"credit-label-wrapper\">Credit:</span> Courtesy Mishi Lifestyle</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mishi Lifestyle</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracy Burnett is founder and owner of Mishi Lifestyle in Lakewood. The home décor and gift store opened in 2021 and is a soothing source for those who wish to surround themselves with objects that evoke tranquility. That includes furniture, home and body scents, jewelry, barware and pet items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People are naturally made for connection, belonging and closeness,” says Burnett. “Love, in all its forms, gives life meaning. But peace and serenity create the space to truly feel and receive that love.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone is looking for a gift that shows they care or one that makes the recipient know they are loved, Mishi Lifestyle is the place. One of Burnett’s favorite items is a mug with the words, “I Wish you Lived Next Door.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a beautiful reminder to a friend or family member that they are missed and loved every time they use it,” says Burnett. “We sell many of these locally in our shop, but we also have shipped them to loved ones all over the country.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burnett also suggests the Mishi Lifestyle Amber Grove Candle “that really sets the stage for a romantic moment.” Think a combination of Egyptian Amber, Himalayan Bamboo and Caribbean Teakwood scents. The soy candle has a 55-hour burn time and is sold in a matte black glass vessel.<em>15602 Detroit Ave., Lakewood, 216-304-3832; <a href=\"http://mishilifestyle.com\" id=\"mishilifestyle.com\" type=\"link\">mishilifestyle.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Océanne</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a heart, but it’s something you can wear all year,” says Anne Harrill, Océanne owner and designer, describing her brass-casted Verona Signet Ring. “It’s classic, one of our best sellers and now we can offer engraving.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>French native Harrill owns three Northeast Ohio jewelry and gift stores, in addition to her online business. Her minimalist, but sophisticated and sometimes whimsical, jewelry designs have made her original work a favorite across generations. Even though she spotlights the heart ring, Harrill says the symbol doesn’t have to be incorporated into jewelry given for February 14. It’s more important that jewelry is selected with the recipient’s taste in mind and not the giver’s, she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, for that extra special Valentine’s Day experience, consider Oceanne’s Forever Jewelry. The recipient chooses a chain at the store, the wrist is measured, a little ring is added and then the clasp-less bracelet is welded closed, to be worn 24/7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a very meaningful experience. We have had couples, mother and daughters, BFFs, bridal parties and three generations make appointments. And it’s affordable. You can choose from several chains, from gold filled to and sterling silver,” says Harrill, adding that if the piece must be removed for whatever reason, it can simply be cut and later a new ring can be attached if desired.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Océanne also offers about 40 different chains and charms in-store including: Heart Padlock, Moon and Star Pearl Charm, Gold Daisy, Evil Eye, Snake, Bee, Four-leaf Clover, Zodiac Signs, Coffee Cup, Fish and more. <em>Crocker Park: 295 Main St., Westlake, 216-802-9981; Pinecrest: 411 Park Ave., Suite 137, Orange, 216-778-9268; Gordon Square: 6519 Detroit Ave., 216-862-7043; <a href=\"http://oceanne.net\" id=\"oceanne.net\" type=\"link\">oceanne.net</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/for-the-love-of-cle/discover-local-valentines-gifts-your-partner-will-actually-love/\">Discover Local Valentine’s Gifts Your Partner Will Actually Love</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",

With DJs every weekend, theme parties, karaoke, trivia and drag shows, Twist is all about energy, connection and inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We want everyone to feel welcome at Twist,” says Cammarn. “We’re not targeting any one specific letter in an acronym. It doesn’t matter if you’re in the community, if you’re straight, gay, bi, transsexual — it does not matter to us. We want everyone to feel welcome at Twist.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you come solo or with friends, expect a packed dance floor, laser lights, and DJs spinning every Friday and Saturday night starting at 10 PM.

You can find speed dating pop-up events throughout the city. They’re a structured and engaging way to meet multiple people in one night, minus the pressure of awkward first dates. Cleveland Speed Dating brings singles together every month for age-targeted events. Whether you’re in your 20s, 30s, 40s, or beyond, you’ll rotate through some of the city’s best restaurants and chat one-on-one with 6 to 12 (sometimes more!) singles in a series of six-minute “Pre-Dates.” After each mini-date, you simply mark who you’d like to see again, and you’ll get your matches emailed to you within 24 hours.<em><a href=\"http://clevelandspeeddating.com\">clevelandspeeddating.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell Your Own Story&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling creative?

Over three rounds, you’ll get offbeat prompts, craft your masterpiece in minutes, and (if you’re feeling bold) share it with the crowd. You can pen a story, choreograph a dance or even belt out a song.

Ninety five percent of what I’m hearing is not controversial at all.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Housing, child care, electric bills, and property taxes — Acton has heard voters complain about all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"h-\">“But the number one thing I am hearing about, and data is now showing this, it’s the rising cost of health care that is really putting people over the edge,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed by President Trump last summer, people looking for health insurance on Affordable Care Act Marketplaces stopped receiving an enhanced subsidy to help cover premiums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of open enrollment last month, Ohio saw a 20% decline in Marketplace enrollment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a percentage basis,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ohioafp.org/wfmu-article/fewer-ohioans-enrolled-in-aca-marketplace-plans-following-elimination-of-enhanced-premium-tax-credits/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians noted</a>, that was the second biggest decline in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Think about that for a second,” Acton said. “We know people are just saying I have to go without health care in order to pay my housing costs that are going up, my electric bill, my childcare bill, they’re just going without insurance, and whole families are going without. That is a big concern.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Acton acknowledged there’s a limit on what she, or any state leader, can do to bridge the gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She brought up Medicaid waivers or tax credits for people caring for loved ones as two examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ll be looking at all the different levers a governor can pull,” Acton said, “but it’s going to have to be in partnership with our federal government.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s so much you can do right now on medical bankruptcy and on prescription drug costs,” Acton’s running mate David Pepper said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You can’t solve it all,” he continued, “but trying to make the premiums maybe a little more affordable, so 20% don’t drop off — that’s happening all over. It’s just not happening in Ohio.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mistakes were made</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Acton and Pepper also called out Ohio Republican governor candidate Vivek Ramaswamy for calling Medicare and Medicaid a mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an appearance on the Ezra Klein podcast in October 2024, Ramaswamy argued there are competing visions within the Republican party for what the “America First” agenda actually means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, he said, there are those who want to use government power to protect or advance American economic interests and on the other — the one Ramaswamy aligns with — there are Republicans who see the project as “dismantling the existence of that nanny state in all of its forms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, Klein asked Ramaswamy point blank if he thought Medicare and Medicaid were mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe they were, with the benefit of retrospect,” Ramaswamy said. “Particularly Medicaid, particularly the welfare state without work attachments required attached to it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 3 million Ohioans — roughly a quarter of the state’s population — are enrolled in Medicaid, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within that population, 72% of enrollees are already working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two and a half million Ohioans are enrolled in Medicare, which primarily covers the elderly, but there’s some overlap between the two programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 400,000 Ohioans on Medicare receive assistance through Medicaid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jan Lanier, a registered nurse from Westerville, spoke about her family’s experience with Medicaid at Acton’s event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lanier explained her youngest granddaughter was born premature with severe disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lanier’s daughter had a job and insurance but lost both because she had to take care of her child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The experience brought all of us into the world of Medicaid, waivers, and wait lists,” Lanier explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 23, her granddaughter still lives with her daughter and they rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of caregivers and medical supplies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I do not expect people running for office to be able to understand all the programs and services that come under their purview,” Lanier said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I do, however, expect them to listen, and to make a serious effort to learn, before dismissively calling something that is the backbone of Ohio’s health care system a ‘mistake.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ramaswamy’s response</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In an emailed statement, Ramaswamy’s campaign spokesperson Connie Luck said Acton’s “far-left approach would drive up health care costs and everyday expenses for all Ohioans, while suppressing take-home pay and economic growth. By contrast, Vivek’s vision for Ohio focuses on real reforms to deliver lower costs and bigger paychecks, not empty promises and government takeovers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Ramaswamy’s ‘mistake’ comment, Luck accused Acton of cherry-picking soundbites and called the attacks “blatantly dishonest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luck said Medicaid is a “vital program,” but insisted it should work better for recipients and taxpayers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Vivek believes Ohioans deserve a Medicaid system that delivers stronger results than what we have seen over the past six decades, including basic work requirements for those who are able,” Luck said. “That position is not extreme, it’s common sense.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Trump’s signature domestic policy bill includes national work requirement provisions for Medicaid recipients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting next year enrollees nationwide will have to start reporting their employment status at least every six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That change will have a big impact on the bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates work requirements alone will reduce Medicaid spending by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/a-closer-look-at-the-work-requirement-provisions-in-the-2025-federal-budget-reconciliation-law/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$326 billion</a>&nbsp;over the next decade, but those savings come with a cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyzing an earlier version of the bill, CBO forecasters suggested the policy would leave&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">4.8 million Americans without insurance by 2034</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-06/57702-Work-Requirements.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2022 CBO report</a>&nbsp;found state-level work requirements cost thousands of workers their coverage, “and they appear to have little effect on employment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Originally published by the <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/02/12/ohio-democratic-governor-candidate-amy-acton-makes-pitch-for-addressing-health-care-costs/\">Ohio Capital Journal.</a> Republished here with permission.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/news/ohio-news/ohio-democratic-governor-candidate-amy-acton-makes-pitch-for-addressing-health-care-costs/\">Ohio Democratic Governor Candidate Amy Acton Makes Pitch for Addressing Health Care Costs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",

He won both the primary and the general election that year by 30 percentage points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That’s what the voters kind of voted to reform,” Ronayne told Scene from a conference room at the County Building on Wednesday. “So, we are continuing to be the reform candidate in the reform government.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronayne is 57 and currently vying for a second term as Cuyahoga County executive, a role leading a region of 1.2 million people and 59 municipalities. As of mid-February, his candidacy is uncontested; he practically will be handed the county’s foremost seat come November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an opportunity Ronayne approaches with excitement. He envisions it as a kind of sequel to a laundry list of accomplishments he listed off from his first term. Successes marked by an pointed expansion of government. In 2023, he opened up the county’s Welcome Center for incoming immigrants; he created the Child Wellness Campus in 2024 to give kids more access to mental health care; the new Office of Violence Prevention, meant to tackle illegal guns, opened up last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s likely Ronayne will champion that same growth energy come 2027, if everything goes as planned. He’ll oversee the construction of the new county jail in Garfield Heights, potential groundbreaking of a remaking of the lakefront and riverfront; trees and pathways sprouting at Irishtown Bend; new music festivals and parks; new bus lanes, bike lanes and highway extensions; new uses for a dwindling Burke Lakefront Airport. (Ronayne’s fingers crossed.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But nothing may better represent Ronayne’s hunger for growth, and his hyper-focused view of county government, than the $1 billion county jail, funded mostly by a sales tax extension, set to break ground this spring in Garfield Heights. It’s the largest project in recent Cuyahoga County history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it involves two of Ronayne’s latest dissenters. Earlier this year, County Prosecutor Michael O’Malley rebuked Ronayne for “illegally” handling County Sheriff Harold Pretel’s payroll, going as far as to threaten a lawsuit. (Pretel wants to control officer pay himself.) Cuyahoga is the only county in the state wherein its sheriff is not elected but assigned by its executive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronayne found it yet another relic of the “old boys” club. He would rather, he said, spend time on progress, on rethinking part of the criminal justice system in the county.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is an ecosystem, a justice ecosystem,” Ronayne said, about the complex. “I don’t wake up out of bed and say, ‘Gee, I’m happy to be building a new jail.’ I’m only happy in as much as I will be building a more humane space.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a space where those awaiting trial or a plea can make use of their time locked up. Like, Ronayne suggested, earning a certificate at a partnering Tri-C program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Look, if your in with us for 30 days,” he said, “you ought to come out with some kind of skill that you can bring to the outside world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will Ronayne’s character and itch for growth continue to warm other members of the bureaucracy? After all, the county executive’s sparred often in the past three years with County Council over a range of issues—from the jurisdiction of the formerly-named Downtown Safety Patrol to what extent county taxpayer funds should be used to keep Downtown clean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to what extent he should be buddying up with Mayor Bibb to actualize plans that he needs Bibb to follow through on. The obvious ones come to mind: How to reimagine the lakefront in a post-Browns world. And what to do with Burke. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s finally creating a county Music Commission, akin to Nashville’s or Austin&#8217;s. There’s expanding the county transit-oriented development loan program and funding housing near transit stops. There’s better utilizing brownfield land, building dedicated bus lanes or making sure people know they have unclaimed funds the state is using to build the new Browns stadium in Brook Park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The overall objective in the next term is to lay out a blueprint for growth and work that plan,” Ronayne told Scene. Despite still losing a half percent of its population per year. “We need to stop that population loss and turn that corner toward population <em>growth</em>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or at least convince the people he&#8217;s <em>trying</em> to reverse a decades-long trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve fought good fights. Some we win, some we lose,” Ronayne said. “But I can always look at myself in the mirror and saying I’m fighting for the people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Do you feel like after all this time you’ve helped restore trust in this seat?” Scene asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yes,” Ronayne said. He smiled. “And I think that’s reflected in not having an opponent” in this race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/ClevesceneNewsletterSignup/Page\"><strong><em>Subscribe to Cleveland Scene newsletters.</em></strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Follow us:&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKQgKIiNDQklTRkFnTWFoQUtEbU5zWlhabGMyTmxibVV1WTI5dEtBQVAB?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen\"><strong><em>Google News</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/@c/1599763?s=01\"><strong><em>NewsBreak</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClevelandScene/\"><strong><em>Reddit</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clevelandscene/\"><strong><em>Instagram</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ClevelandScene\"><strong><em>Facebook&nbsp;</em></strong></a><strong><em>|&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClevelandScene\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com/news/cleveland-news/eyeing-easy-re-election-chris-ronayne-promises-growth-for-cuyahoga-county-in-second-term/\">Eyeing Easy Re-election, Chris Ronayne Promises Growth for Cuyahoga County in Second Term</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.clevescene.com\">Cleveland Scene</a>.</p>",
